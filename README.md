## FrSKY Bluetooth Joystick Proof-of-Concept

Some code I threw together to show that FrSKY transmitters can be directly used as a joystick input over bluetooth without the need for an additional dongle.

Not intended to be used as-is but welcome anyone who wants to use the concept to create a interface.
